# MyPhotosAlbum

This project was created to make use of ReactiveJSON network framework(https://github.com/jasonranderson/ReactiveJSON). Basically, it's an app that presents random data from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com, utilized in this case to present a list of users with several photo albums. After an album is selected, a collection of photos is shown.

To use it, just download the project and the dependencies with Carthage. The project is coded in Swift 2.3 since ReactiveJSON dependencies were compiled using that version.
